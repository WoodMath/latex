		\logentry{6}{14}{2016}{%
Working on implementing [Park2003]~\cite{Park2003} in MatLab. \newline
\par Also working on implementing Spectral Clustering (for images) in MatLab. Started working on \texttt{fnDistance.m} to calculate pixel distances (\textit{Distance Matrix}) for vectorized (row major and column major) images, needed for segmentation through spectral clustering.
		}
		\logentry{6}{16}{2016}{%
Added some additional text regarding the \textit{epipolar constraint} to the thesis document.
		}
		\logentry{6}{17}{2016}{%
Finished implmenting and testing \texttt{fnDistance.m} for distance matrix. Next finished working on and testing \texttt{fnSimilarity.m} implementing a \textit{Similarity Matrix} for spectral clustering.
		}
		\logentry{6}{18}{2016}{%
Wrote small amount additional text on \textit{epipolar contstraint}, and verified understanding through MatLab functions.

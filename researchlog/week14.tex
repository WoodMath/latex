Continued setting up \texttt{PrimeSense} and \texttt{Kinect}. Having problems with \texttt{Java} extensions in \texttt{OpenNI2}.

Tested \textit{spectral clustering} code on reduced size image. See \texttt{Wood\_Kamangar/StatusReports/StatusReport\_14/spectral\_clustering/} directory. \newline

\par The results of the algorithm can be viewed in \texttt{img\_write.png} which contains different gray-values for segmented areas. The file \texttt{im\_fruit.png} was reduced in size to be the file \texttt{im\_test.png}. The results can be reproduced by the following code:\newline


\texttt{%
im\_test = imread('im\_test.png');\newline
img\_write = fnSegTest(im\_test);\newline
}

\par I still need to implment code to get sub images of original size.
